## Task_7 : JavaScript Learning Notes (Core to Advanced)

## Introduction

This repository contains short and easy-to-understand notes on JavaScript concepts from basic to advanced level.
It is designed for beginners who want a quick revision and clear understanding of JavaScript used in real-world web development.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to:
Understand JavaScript fundamentals
Learn modern ES6+ features
Practice clean and readable concepts
Prepare for interviews and frontend development
Build strong programming logic

## 1) Core JavaScript
let / const → block scoped variables
Data Types → primitive & reference
Truthy / Falsy → values treated as true or false
Operators → ===, !==, &&, ||, ?:
Conditionals → if, else, ternary

## 2) Functions
Function declaration & expression
Arrow functions → () => {}
Default parameters → fallback values
Return values → send output from function

## 3) Objects & Arrays
Object creation & access → {} , dot / bracket
Array basics → [], index-based
Array methods
map() → transform
filter() → filter data
find() → find one item
reduce() → single output
some() / every() → boolean result

## 4) Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
Destructuring → extract values
Spread (...) → copy / merge
Rest (...) → collect arguments
Template literals → ${} syntax

## 5) Modules & Classes
import / export → share code
ES6 Classes → object blueprint
Constructor → auto-run method
extends / super → inheritance
this keyword → current object

## 6) Asynchronous JavaScript
Callbacks → function inside function
Promises → async handling
async / await → readable async code
try...catch → error handling

## 7) Advanced JavaScript Concepts
Scope → global / function / block
Closures → access outer scope
Immutability → avoid direct mutation
Higher-order functions → functions using functions

## 8) Browser & Runtime
DOM basics → HTML as JS objects
Event handling → user interactions
Event bubbling → child → parent
LocalStorage / SessionStorage → browser storage
JSON → parse() & stringify()

## Conclusion
This repository provides a compact overview of JavaScript concepts from beginner to advanced level.
It helps learners revise topics quickly, understand modern syntax, and build a strong foundation for frontend or full-stack development.
